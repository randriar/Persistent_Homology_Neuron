%  INPUTS:
%   sample - N-by-3 matrix: a list of N sample points (3-dim coordinates)
%   gridx - vector: a list of coordinates along the x-axis to consider
%   gridy - vector: a list of coordinates along the y-axis to consider
%   gridz - vector: a list of coordinates along the z-axis to consider
%
%  OUTPUT:
%   f - 3D-tensor: a tensor of probability density estimates evaluated at the 
%                  points in 3D-grid defined by GRIDX, GRIDY, and GRIDZ.
%                  The estimates are based on a normal kernel function, using 
%                  standard deviations (bandwidth) that are either given by BW.

% Some basic size values.

% Make copies for each data point in the sample.

x = repmat(gridx, [1,1,1,n]);
y = repmat(gridy, [1,1,1,n]);

% Record the coordinates for each data point in the sample as "mean values"
% for subsequent normal distributions.

muz = repmat(muz,[nx,ny,nz,1]);

% For each point in the in the 3D mesh, compute the contribution at that
% point coming from all normal probability distributions in each of the
% three coordinate directions centered around each sample point with bandwidth
% given by BW.
% Multiply these density values to obtain to total probability density at the 
% given mesh point.
